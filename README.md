## Project Overview

**Django-CRM** is a web-based customer record management system built with Django. It allows users to securely register, log in, and manage customer records (CRUD operations). The project leverages Django's authentication, forms, messaging, and admin interface for a robust user experience.

**Main Features:**
- User registration and authentication
- Add, update, delete, and view customer records
- Secure access (only authenticated users can manage records)
- Django admin for record management
- Responsive HTML templates

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.x
- Django 5.1.6
- MySQL (via `mysqlclient`)

## Architecture

- **Project Root**: `DCRM/` (Django project)
- **Main App**: `WEBSITE/`
- **Database**: MySQL (configured in `DCRM/settings.py`)
- **Templates**: Located in `WEBSITE/templates/`
- **Custom Scripts**: `mydb.py` (for DB creation)

### Django Apps
- `WEBSITE`: Contains models, forms, views, templates, and URLs for customer record management.

### Key Files
- `manage.py`: Django management utility
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `mydb.py`: Script to create the MySQL database
- `DCRM/settings.py`: Project settings, DB config, installed apps
- `DCRM/urls.py`: Root URL routing
- `WEBSITE/models.py`: Customer record model
- `WEBSITE/forms.py`: User registration and record forms
- `WEBSITE/views.py`: Business logic for all main workflows
- `WEBSITE/urls.py`: App-specific routes
